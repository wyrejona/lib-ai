  "citing  - mentioning  the work of others  in your own work.": "Referencing  is used to tell the reader  where  ideas from other  sources  have been used in an assignment. The reference  list is a list of all the sources  used (and cited)  in an assignment.  It is usually alphabetized  according  to the names  of the authors.  Each entry  in the reference  list contains  detailed  information  about  one source.  There  are many  reasons  why it is important to reference sources correctly: • It shows  the reader  how your argument  relates  to the entire  perspective  on a situation or issue • It properly  credits  the originators  of ideas,  theories,  and research  findings • It shows  the reader  that you can find and use sources  to create  a solid argument. e.g The more involved  or consulted  people  are, the greater  will be their commitment in its implementation  and sustenance  of the projects.  (Mulwa,  2002). In this example,  “(Mulwa, 2002)” tells the  reader that this information has come from a source  written  by Mulwa,  which  was published  in 2002.  This is a signpost, pointing  the reader to the reference list. Referencing  styles Referencing  is a formal  system:  there  are rules and standards  to follow  when formatting citations  and references.  Many students  find referencing  quite intimidating  at first. Like any skill, it takes  time and patience  to learn. The examples  above  use APA style,  a format  created  by the American  Psychological Association.  It is the most common  referencing  style used at the University  of Embu. Other  styles  include  MLA style,  Oxford  style,  Harvard  style,  and Chicago  style. Referencing  tools The following  are the recommended  software  and tools that help with creating  or managing references. • Mendeley  - is a reference  manager  and academic  social  network.  It is also a free pdf manager,  take your own fully searchable  library  in seconds,  cite as you write,  and read and annotate  your PDFs on any device • Zotero  - Zotero  helps  to collect,  organize,  cite, and share  research sources. You can add PDFs,  images,  audio  and video  files, snapshots  of web pages, and really  anything  else. Zotero automatically  indexes  the full-text content  of your library, enabling  you to find exactly  what you’re  looking  for with just a few keystrokes.
